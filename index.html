    Welcome to MacDevMike's Code Journey

  </div>

  <div id="intro">

<br>
Ten years ago when I realized that IT was really the janitorial staff of technology, I started considering a change in fields. When it came to programming, back then most of your options were to go back to school or head to Barnes and Nobles and start reading programming books.
</br>

<br>
Today, there are so many ways to learn how to write code. And you aren’t limited on platforms either. Between You Tube, iTunes University, Khan Academy, and amazing educational platforms like Lynda.com, you can start with the fundamentals and go just about anywhere. This includes high level languages (Ruby, Python, etc) and lower level root languages that are closer to the metal like the C language derivatives (Objective-C, C++, C#, etc.)
</br>
<br>
The beauty of today is that you have a variety of methods for learning. I find that I learn better when I have multiple sources available for the same information. When you think about it, this is the way traditional schooling works. You go to class, listen to a lecture, go do your homework and turn it in for review. You can now do these things without spending a dime. And specifically with programming, there is no limit to what you can learn on your own. With sites like Stack Overflow, you have a community of experts that can review any code you submit and offer advise, clarify questions and concepts, and assist you as a group of peers.
</br>

<br>
Once I made the conscious decision to chase my dream, I did some programming on Code Academy using JavaScript as the initial language. I found that it was alot like some C++ that I learned a few years prior, and I took to it pretty quickly. But the biggest challenge was that you are going through a program that is somewhat rigid and designed to teach more syntax then anything else. I wanted to build things.
</br>

<br>
That's when I discovered coding bootcamps, and Dev Bootcamp in particular. After getting myself ready over the Christmas 2014 break for an admissions assessment where you will be asked to do some actual Ruby programming, I was accepted into their amazing program. Now actively part of the Dev Bootcamp 'Pocket Gophers' cohort, I will be using this site to document my journey. We will be studying HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, and SQL to name a few of the fundamental coding areas that Dev Bootcamp teaches. Oh, and one more thing: This is all done in nine weeks of online learning, and nine weeks of onsite learning that totals over 1000 hours of programming in 18 weeks. Prepare to drink from the firehose of knoweldge.
</br>
<br>
If you have always yearned to be “That guy” that can write code for just about any platform, the universe is trying to accommodate you. Hopefully this page will show one man's journey going from knowing almost nothing about actual programming to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Enjoy!
