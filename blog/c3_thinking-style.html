    Reviewing my learning style

  </div>



  <div id="intro">
<br>
Before attending Dev Bootcamp, we were given some prep work to do before the Phase 0 online work started. One of the items on the list was to take a test that would provide our Gregorc Learning style. Usually, I kind of roll my eyes at these kind of things, but I have alot of faith in the DBC process and got to work. When I got the results, I was simply shocked at how accurate it seemed to be.
</br>
<br>
The results break indiciduals down into four quadrants: Abstract Sequential (AS), Concrete Sequential (CS), Abstract Random (AR), and Concrete Random (CR). Each area is scored, and you look at what your overall tendencies seem to be. For me, my AS score was 11, AR was 10, CR was 6 and CS was 3. So clearly I heavely lean towards both Abstract zones, with a bit of Concrete Sequential and almost no Concrete Random. So what did this mean?
</br>
<br>
First lets look at the two general zones (Abstract and Random) as defined directly by Anthony Gregord:
</br>

<br>
The Abstract quality measures how you to visualize, conceive ideas, and understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications.
</br>
<br>
The Concrete quality measures how you register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts.
</br>
<br>
So clearly, I tend to visualize ideas in general, and I draw heavily on intuition and imagination. In theory, I don't deal as much with the obvious but with some reliance on CS, I do tap in a little.
</br>
<br>
Next lets look at the two other quadrants: Random and Sequential:
</br>
<br>
Sequential allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.
</br>
<br>
Random lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.
</br>
<br>
  When you look at my AR and AS tendencies, it boils down to some simple facts that were enlightning for me. Overall, there are some pros and cons for me to consider. The list looks something like this:
</br>
<p id="listo">
  Pro's:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm good at working in groups, and tend to thrive</li>
  <li>I'm good at analyzing situations before acting</li>
  <li>I'm good at applying logic to find solutions for problems</li>
  <li>I learn best in a stimulating environment with access to experts</li>
  <li>I'm good listening to others and bringing harmony to groups</li>
  <li>As good as I am at working with others, I also can thrive alone</li>
</ul>
<p id="listo">
  Con's:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm not as good when I don't have enough time to study something thoroughly</li>
  <li>I get bored repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
  <li>I tend to monopolize coversations</li>
  <li>I don't care for competition much in the working or learning place</li>
  <li>I don't accept criticism well</li>
  <li>I don't work well with people who don't seem friendly</li>
</ul>
<br>
  Looking back, I have found that both of these lists are laser accurate. When learning the information for the first three weeks of Phase 0, I have found that when I'm struggling it helps to revisit the list of strengths on this list. With a couple of exercises that I was stuck on in week 3, I would pair. I work good in groups, and tend to thrive in a group which brings out some of my best learning tendencies. I start on my work for the next week on the weekend before specifically so that I have enough time to study it throughly, because I am aware that thats an issue for me.
</br>
<br>
  Lastly, it helps to consider that before DBC I was certainly someone suffering from a fixed mindset. I didn't like to step out and challenge myself, and tend to hide in hopes people won't discover that I have any weaknesses. One thing that I seem to be having some success in is reaching outside that comfort zone, and begin drinking in large amounts of new information. When you consider my learning styles, it helps to strategize about how to emphasize my strengths, avoid learning weaknesses and slowly move towards a growth mindset. I feel good about the sucesses I have had so far, and am very excited for what the future holds.
