    Feedback and how you use it

  </div>



  <div id="intro">
<br>
Here we are at the end of week 5 of Dev Bootcamp. Over the course of the last four weeks, we have learned a great deal about HTML, CSS, Ruby and other misc tools that are useful in the art of programming. But one of the cornerstone things that has occurred along the way is that we have worked closely together over Google Hangouts to conduct our pair programming sessions. And at the end of each of these sessions, we provide each other feedback in hopes that we can make each other more effective.</br>
<br>
The scary thing about this process is that you have to put yourself out there if you want to receive the feedback. And as most people are aware, people are sensitive when it comes to receiving feedback. Each of us has a list of insecurities, weaknesses that in many circumstances we are aware of. We all want to be better people, but its one thing to conceptualize it and completely something else to do what is required to make that a realistic expectation.
</br>
<br>
What makes things even more interesting is that at Dev Bootcamp, most of us are very inexperienced programmers that are learning at a high velocity. And with some of the challenges that we face during the week, we struggle with learning new concepts, new Ruby methods, new ways of attacking coding scenarios. And this can create situations where the mood of the pairing challenge can be quite tense. Sometimes we feel embarrassed that we don’t automatically know what to do or how to solve the challenge. So when we set that as the stage for providing feedback to a colleague, one might think that the feedback could be skewed. So in looking at my feedback, how did I do?
</br>

<br>
I was really surprised early on with how detailed and fair the feedback I’ve received has been. Our cohort is a bit of an anomaly, and has been very close early in the process. We seem to care about one another, and spend a lot of time together in a Google Chat room helping each other out with everything except Solo Challenges. Getting positive feedback from a band of brothers and sisters has been very gratifying for me. Not all of it has been positive, but all of it has been fair.
</br>
<br>
  In the case where I have received the most critical (and accurate) feedback so far came when I paired with someone and had already done a significant amount of the work. This was during week four, when the challenges got much more difficult and I was actually insecure about joining a mandatory pair and not fully understand what I was doing. But this came at the detriment of my pair, who really felt unprepared because I had already done about half the work. It put them at a disadvantage, and actually caused them to realize some of there worst fears in pairing. This was great for me though, because now I review the challenge but make sure that I haven’t solved any issues before the pairing. I don’t fear a situation where I don’t have the answers but I look at it as an opportunity to improve.</br>
<br>
Getting Dev Bootcamp feedback has been a much more significant piece of my learning that one would think. And I will look to consistently provide this feedback with colleagues in the work place long after my journey at Dev Bootcamp has come to a close.
