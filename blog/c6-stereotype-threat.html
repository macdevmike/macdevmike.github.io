    My kids and stereotype threat

  </div>



  <div id="intro">
<br>
Stereotype threat is a new concept for me. While I am aware of certain forms of racisms and cultural biases that exist in our country, I have lived in California my entire life. And most of that stay has been in the Northern California Bay Area, home to San Francisco and likely the most progressive and accepting piece of real estate in the world. Fortunately I haven’t had to deal with the monster that is a human’s capacity for hating another that they have never met.</br>
<br>
To begin with, stereotype threat isn’t directly a form of racism but really an indirect byproduct. The concept is basically that a common stereotype for a group of people can cause someone a natural tendency to feel threatened that they will become “yet another” member of that group. And this tends to manifest itself in certain studies when evaluating different groups of people in education. For example, if blacks are seen as succumbing to learning difficulties when they belong to low income families.
</br>
<br>
While I haven’t directly encountered stereotype threat, I do have three children that are all of mixed nationality. They are half German, and half African American. They don’t suffer from the traditional low income stereotype, but I could see how this kind of thing could manifest itself in their lives. And of course, as a parent I want to do everything in my power to foster a life for them that supports life long learning. The idea that a stereotype could try to pull them into fearing circumstances where they would become another statistic that enforces the stereotype is troublesome to me.
</br>

<br>
As a parent, my experience is that my children are unaware of these threats. That if I continue to foster them with cultural values that encourage studying, the value of a good education, and the tools to allow them freedom in their learning that they will embrace the opportunities afforded to them.
</br>
<br>
 While I have never directly encountered or been affected by stereotype threat, I am happy for exposure to the issue. It provides me yet another tool in parenting three children of mixed heritage.</br>
