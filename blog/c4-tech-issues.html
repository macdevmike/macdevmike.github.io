    The importance of Net Neutrality

  </div>



  <div id="intro">
<br>
One of the major issues facing the tech industry, and even the world at large are regarding the freedom of use on the internet. In a battle that has been played out recently in the public media, it has commonly been referred to as Net Neutrality. So what is net neutrality, and why does the tech community care about it? Why has it become such a major source of contention that the main stream media has been covering it?</br>
<br>
To get things started, lets have a look at what the term means. Net neutrality (short for network neutrality, net equality, internet neutrality, etc) is the principle that ISP’s (Internet Service Providers) and other peripheral entities should treat all data on the internet equally, and no discriminating should take place based on data type, usage, content, delivery, platform or application. Basically, it is the concept that if we are paying a service provider for a service, what we are using it for should be covered under privacy. So if I am using the internet, and I go to a site that my ISP doesn’t like, they shouldn’t be able to modify or prohibit my usage, throttle the speed of my access to the site, charge me extra to view the content I am trying to access, or have any impact on my user experience. Sounds like a no brainer right?
</br>
<br>
Think again.
</br>

<br>
One example of a violation over this process  that has been raging over the last twelve months has been between streaming video provider Netflix, and consumer ISP Comcast. It came out in the press a while back that Comcast was actually throttling their customers network speeds if the customer was trying to watch a Netflix streaming movie. And while consumers were outraged, there was little they could actually do about it. The more technical of the audience simply hid our content behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or used a network proxy to relay our access requests off to cloak the ability for Comcast to detect that we were using our Netflix streaming. But if you aren’t technical, what do you do? In most areas, there is only one true broadband provider, and sometimes an alternate (like AT&T with their DSL service) that provides internet access, but at 80% less speed. So there were no opportunities for individuals to leave Comcast for another service that offered equivalent value.
</br>
<br>
But when the main stream media stepped in was when talk show host John Oliver did  a segment on Net Neutrality, and how ludicrous the situation currently is. The segment went viral, getting over 8 million unique views and inciting the outrage of hundreds of thousands of Americans to send email to the FCC to get new neutrality regulated. Protecting our privacy and establish a process for fair use of a service we are paying is a simple concept. The fact that large companies would like companies to be forced to pay for “fast lanes” on the internet is simply unethical.</br>
<br>
Fortunately, the American people and the FCC have spoken. On February 26, 2015 the FCC Voted 3-2 to in favor of protecting an open internet by governing ISP and Mobile Internet Service Providers (I’m looking at you Verizon, AT&T and Sprint) by reclassifying them under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which regulates the services as public utilities. This is essentially like a high school bully getting dragged out behind the shed by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and getting the tar kicked out of him. It doesn’t mean the battle is over (their is likely to be litigation regarding if FCC is indeed authorized to reclassify them as utilities, but thus far thus far the FCC’s ruling has met with the full support of the President.) But for now, internet freedoms have been upheld.
