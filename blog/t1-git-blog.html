      As Bilbo Baggins said in "The Lord of the Rings" film "It's a scary business Frodo..going out your door. You step on to the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off.." When undertaking something as ambitious as computer programming, I am reminded of this quote. Making a decision to leave the comfort of my daily life, and all of the creature comforts that are familiar to me in order to embark on an adventure brings many feelings. Fear. Self doubt. Panic. Those are the negative ones trying to tell you that you are doing something reckless. And yet...there is that other voice that we listened to when we were little. The voice that says "This adventure is going to be wonderful too. And I can't wait."

        When starting out on our programming journey, establishing good habits up front is critical. And learning core concepts like version control, and the tools like Git and GitHub to support the concept are important to learn early. Version control allows a programmer to make consistant saves during development, and encourages experimentation with the code due to the freedom of "rolling back" to a prior version.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where version control provides the process for saving different versions of your code, Git provides the method. With Git, we have a command line tool and repository system that lets us make incremental saves, and a robust set of tools that allow us to work on individual versions of specific code files. Created by coding legend Linus Torvalds, Git was originally designed for open source coders to work on different "branches" of code for the Linux operating system. Using Git, a programmer can "clone" a piece of code locally, make modifications and "push" these updated "commits" back to the master code branch that is being worked on. As you can see, Git provides a nice way for a group of programmers to coordinate their work on a shared project.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leaves the final piece: GitHub. As the name implies, GitHub provides a shared social space where programmers can share a "Hub" of code branches. These branches are then merged in a master branch. As the code evolves, each of the developers can fetch the latest changes to the "master branch" which serves as the source of truth in the project.
