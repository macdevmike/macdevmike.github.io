    The Dev Bootcamp Experience

  </div>

  <div id="intro">
<br>
In 2006, I attempted to go back to school for a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on game design theory. After a little over ten years in IT work, I was ready to start building something. But life has a way of throwing us curve balls, and with the work loud of the program and the need to keep a roof over my head, I simply couldnt manage a challenging program and work full time.
</br>
<br>
In March of 2014, something happened that changed my perception of my life. My mom lost hers. Having suffered on and off with heart issues since 1999, my mother had been full of life and good cheers. I woke from a deep sleep at 2am, something I never really do and immediately knew that something was wrong. I got up, and went downstairs for a glass of water, and about five minutes later there was a load knock at my door. The Police Department was there on my porch at 2:15am to let me know that mother had passed away in her sleep. They needed to take me to her.
</br>
<br>
It took time for me to deal with the reality of how short life is. But over the last year I continue to learn to deal with that loss. My mom and I were always close, and this was the first true loss I had suffered. Then one day I was at home going through some things when I came across a book mark that my mom had bought me, and tucked inside of the latest Stephen King novel that she dropped off after some shopping about six months earlier. It read "Believe. It's never too late to become what you were meant to be."
</br>
<br>
Deep down inside, I have always known I was meant to be a develper. And this moment...whether casual occurance or manifest destiny spoke to me. This was the time. My mother had left me a substantial sum of money, and I could actually put life on hold for a bit, and take the book marks message to heart. I sat down at the computer, and I began doing some research. And that's where I found Dev Bootcamp.
</br>

<br>
After countless hours of research, there are many things about Dev Bootcamp that I have become a deep believer in. But at its foundation is the environments dependendency on the students to bond together, support each other, and create a condusive learning experience together. And the more energy that is put into this task, the better the learning experience rewards the students. And as we have begun Phase 0, and the prep work is underway, it's even better then I had hoped. Our cohort has really come together quickly, starting a Google Hangout and encouraging everyone to chat together a week before Phase 0 even began. My expectations haven't changed, and I continue to believe that this program will be rigorously difficult, challenge me at every corner and be one of the biggest adventures of my life. I continue to be thankful that Shareef put this program together, and that I have such a great group of people to work with.

<br>
As my fellow gopher Edwin is fond of saying: I'm not a developer yet, but I'm going to be.
