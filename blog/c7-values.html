  The values that started my journey

  </div>



  <div id="intro">
<br>
I am very excited to be a part of Dev Bootcamp. I felt that way when I was preparing to apply in December because I was sacrificing my two week Christmas vacation from work, and spending that time with my nose in various (intimidating) programming books. And I certainly felt that way when I was accepted and went dancing around my house feeling really good about myself. But what started all this? What values led me to give up my Christmas vacation to study, get accepted into the DBC program, and give up my (rather good) job at a software company? The answer might surprise you.</br>
<br>
I am towards to upper middle area of DBC’s age group. At 42 years old when I was accepted, I had already had a decent career in the IT community. But back in 1998 I worked for a video game company. There, I received a ring side seat for the development of some world class games. The programmers on those projects made me feel like what I was doing was like pumping gas, and they were designing race cars. I could show up with a beer helmet, and cheer from the side lines but I wasn’t one of them. But I have wanted to be a programmer ever since. And watching fifteen years tick by without doing more to make that a reality is something I regret.
</br>
<br>
Some of my deepest values in life include having a family, having a great relationship with my wife, being a great friend that values friendship, and finally growing as a person. But most of these items have been met for many years now, and thats a true blessing. However, I have felt that the “growing” in my career is something that has been lacking for years. And I finally decided that this value was being so disregarded that it was beginning to cause me emotional pain and frustration as a working adult. And one morning, I simply woke up and decided that (dammit) I was going to do something about it. And this brought me to DBC.
</br>

<br>
This brings to one of my insecurities to light. As someone that isn’t 22 years old, I have some significant life experience in both my career and my personal life. I don’t feel like someone that’s in his forties, but here I am. I suppose that arriving onsite could lead me to feel “over the hill” so to speak. But I like to think that I could have a tremendous career as a programmer over the next twenty five years. But I do fear having some stereotype threat from my age group.
</br>
<br>
To address this, I have decided to just be myself and exercise patience and understanding with those around me. And of course, try to be the best colleague to my fellow Fiery Skippers that I can be during our time together in the program. The goal of my journey has always been personal and career growth, and I want to make sure that I commit all of my efforts towards driving that initiative forward.</br>
