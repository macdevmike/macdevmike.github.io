This week I had a great pairing session with Jeff Greer, and our Guide was Gary Sperka. Jeff and I had a good session setting up an HTML site in short order, and I was impressed at how much I felt like I had learned from last week. Even though my mind has moved on to Week 3 Ruby challenges, it was cool to go back to week 2 CSS/HTML and build a site out real quick.

It was also a great session talking with Gary, who made time before and after to discuss this challenge, and also allowed us to ask numerous questions about programming out in the real world. He was a fantastic guide, and I can't wait to work with him again.
